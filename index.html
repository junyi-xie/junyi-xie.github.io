                        <p>Fifth and also the final project during my first year as "Computer Software and Media Applications" student. For this project, my tasks were to make a reservation website for Hotel California. There are a couple of requirements for this project, the first one being that the code must be Object-Orientated PHP and the second one being you must use PHP Data Objects. Being my final project this year I am planning to deliver fantastic results.</p>

                        <p>Fourth project and the third one which was done with another person. We got requested by one of the bakery teachers from <a href="https://mborijnland.nl/">mboRijnland</a> to build them a webshop, since every day they produced more than they sold and had to throw out the leftovers. Our tasks were to build a webshop in PHP, which could sell their products, a payment method (Mollie), and an admin panel to edit the stocks, opening hours, and view the orders placed by customers.</p>

                        <p>Second project and my first one doing it with another person. The purpose of this project was to teach me the basic of how to use a Content Management System (CMS), for this project I used WordPress. The website I made primarily sold classrooms to their customers. You could buy a classroom by requesting a quotation. Overall this project was very educational, it taught me the basics of a CMS, and how to work together with another person.</p>

                        <p>This was my first project I have worked on. With some guidance from instructors, I quickly learned how to program in HTML5 and CSS3, with some JavaScript here and there. This website was made for <a href="https://www.stichtingkafountine.nl/">Sticting Kafountine</a>. The website contained some information about their project called Satang Jabang, a school for females. As this was my first project I am satisfied with the outcome and what I have learned from it. I plan on improving myself more.</p>
